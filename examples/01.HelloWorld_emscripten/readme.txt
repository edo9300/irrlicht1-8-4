emscripten is a project to compile c/c++ code int the asm.js format which can be run in some browsers.
See http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site for more information.

emscripten support for Irrlicht is a work in process. Use at your own risk. 
Might take work and knowledge to get it running.
